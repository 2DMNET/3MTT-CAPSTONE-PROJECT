## PROJECT PREVIEW
----

1. Overview
This project analyzes and predicts COVID-19 trends using the country_wise_latest dataset. Key goals include forecasting confirmed cases and identifying high-risk countries through classification models.

2. Objectives
Time-Series Forecasting: Predict confirmed cases for the next 14 days using ARIMA.

3. Predictions
Time-Series: ARIMA forecasts highlight potential increases or declines in cases based on regional factors.

4. Insights
High-risk countries often have higher CFRs, low testing rates, and high population density.
Time-series trends emphasize the importance of proactive containment measures.
5. Visualizations
Line Chart: Forecasted vs. actual confirmed cases.
Feature Importance: Key factors influencing high-risk classification.
Confusion Matrix: Classification model performance.
This project demonstrates the value of machine learning in understanding and predicting pandemic dynamics, aiding resource allocation and policy decisions
